Making challenges like Kaggle and share masked dataset 
------------------------------------------------------
	- others to partially solve our need

API based products /interactions with others 
--------------------------------------------
API as products
---------------
	- internal API (API based dataset providing)
	- Partener API
	- External / Open API
	- dataset providing
	- What are options?
	- Provide some in API market and expect ?

Here is a quick and dirty cheat sheet for some common stuff you want
to do in sphinx and ReST.  You can see the literal source for this
file at :ref:`cheatsheet-literal`.
   

.. _formatting-text:

Formatting text
===============

You use inline markup to make text *italics*, **bold**, or ``monotype``.

You can represent code blocks fairly easily::

   import numpy as np
   x = np.random.rand(12)

Or literally include code:

.. literalinclude:: pyplots/ellipses.py

.. _making-a-list:

Making a list
=============

It is easy to make lists in rest

Bullet points
-------------

This is a subsection making bullet points

* point A

* point B

* point C


Enumerated points
------------------

This is a subsection making numbered points

#. point A

#. point B

#. point C


.. _making-a-table:

Making a table
==============

This shows you how to make a table -- if you only want to make a list see :ref:`making-a-list`.

==================   ============
Name                 Age
==================   ============
John D Hunter        40 
Cast of Thousands    41
And Still More       42
==================   ============

.. _making-links:

Making links
============

It is easy to make a link to `yahoo <http://yahoo.com>`_ or to some
section inside this document (see :ref:`making-a-table`) or another
document.

You can also reference classes, modules, functions, etc that are
documented using the sphinx `autodoc
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html>`_ facilites.  For example,
see the module :mod:`matplotlib.backend_bases` documentation, or the
class :class:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.LocationEvent`, or the method
:meth:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase.mpl_connect`.
